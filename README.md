# todoProject

This is the readme file for the todo project.

The data is stored in the file "tasks.txt".

With this program you can create, update and delete todo tasks, on top of searching for specific ones. If the data storing file doesn't exist the program will create it upon creating your first task. Upon running the program, it will display all the completed and incompleted tasks of the current day.

The program doesn't need any argument to run. Simply download and extract the files, give the program file permission to run by entering this command in the terminal: "chmod +x todo.sh", then enter this command to run the program: "./todo.sh".
